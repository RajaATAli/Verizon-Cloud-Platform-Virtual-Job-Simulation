## Programme Duration and Role

Over the course of `one week`, I played the role of a `Cloud Computing Engineer` at the `Verizon Cloud Computing Team.` 

This program has enabled me to immerse myself in the day-to-day operations of a CCE at Verizon, actively engage with senior team members, comprehend their objectives, and produce valuable contributions to key projects. Additionally, I've honed my understanding of `Agile methodologies`, grasped the core aspects of `cloud-native applications`, `interacted with and tested a cloud application via Python`, and adeptly presented my findings. Moreover, I've developed a deep understanding of the **three crucial elements of cloud application security** - network, application, and data, while enhancing my ability to conduct technical research, compile insightful findings, and create impactful PowerPoint presentations.

## Tasks Overview
